*/*MAKE SURE TO READ THIS ALL THE WAY THROUGH*\*

This file will give you things you need to know about this cfg.

To install:	Replace your custom folder in /Steam/SteamApps/common/Team Fortress 2/tf 		with this folder. Make sure it is named "custom" like the folder you 			replaced it with.

HUD: modified version of rayshud

Hitsound: Quake 3 (pitch variability in /Custom Configs/cfg/settings.cfg)

Modifications:
	-All killfeed icons are consistent and more detailed (breaks in sv_pure 2)
	-Backstab animations are a poke
	-Disguising gives you and others class specific hats
	-Ambassador is replaced with a sniper
	-Killstreaks pulse instead of gliding across the weapon
	-Solemn Vow looks like Gabe Newell
	-Dead Ringer looks like iPod Touch
	-Jarate looks like OxiClean
	-Backstab sound is Jerma saying "BAYKESHTAYBE!"
	-Stickybomb sound is STAR_ saying "Sticky spam!"

Most of these don't work on Valve servers due to sv_pure 0

Things to know:

By default, stabbystabby's settings are enabled. You either need to have a good computer, low quality graphics, or great internet (preferably a combination of these) to run. It is set like that by default in /Custom Configs/cfg/settings.cfg. Change it in there to set it to a different network setting on start-up. Or, type stabbynet/goodnet/morenet/badnet (ordered from most demanding to least) to change network settings respectively.

For Spy;

F1-F3 acts like the quick disguise menu that is disabled. Pressing F4 will change which team you disguise (default is enemy disguise).

Looking at the bottom of aliases will give you letters to type in the console to automatically connect to a server. Just type in the one word that is after alias. Example: type jumpacadny into the console to connect to Jump Academy's New York server

Typing "exec regen" into the console will enable a regeneration script for servers that you are an administrator on, primarily for rocket jumping, sticky jumping, detonator jumping, and trimping.

Holding right shift and press 1-9 (not number pad) will quickly switch you to the corresponding class.

Holding alt will quickly deploy a banner as Soldier (if one is equipped and fully charged)

As Spy, when you sap a sentry it will say you are sapping.
As Spy, holding alt will provide a zoom in like a scope (ideally for ambassador).

I use Chris' High FPS config mixed with Cowmanglia's FPS config for /Custom Configs/cfg/gfx.cfg. Feel free to replace those with yours or the one you want.

Please feel free to change the binds to whatever you want, but look at what you are doing first. If you want to change whether weapon models are off or on, go into /Custom Configs/ cfg/crosshairswitcher/settings.cfg and change the "nomodel" to "yesmodel" to enable it, and vice versa to disable. You may need to go into /Custom Configs/cfg/aliases.cfg and change it there for some class weapons.

THIS USES LOW GRAPHICS DESIGNED FOR HIGHER FPS! REPLACE EVERYTHING IN /Custom Configs/cfg/gfx.cfg WITH YOUR OWN CUSTOM GRAPHIC SETTINGS (go to clugu.com/tf2mate for pre-made graphic settings)!!! THAT FILE WILL DECREASE GRAPHICS SETTINGS FOR HIGHER FRAME RATES. IF YOU HAVE A GOOD COMPUTER AND/OR DO NOT WANT BAD GRAPHICS, PLEASE CHANGE IT!!!

Thanks to the internet for providing pre-made scripts and giving me the information to make some custom scripts.

I borrowed from too many people, but I'd like to thank the TF2 Wiki, Chris (for his cfgs) and TF2Mate (for setting them up), stabbystabby, and my friends for testing this out for me after tons of begging. Also, thanks to Ray for making Rayshud, such an awesome hud.

Shoutout to all these fantastic TF2 modders. I love me some mods.
